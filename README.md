# Binary_search
Binary Search is defined as a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.<br />
The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(log N) <br />
# Conditions for when to apply Binary Search in a Data Structure To apply Binary Search algorithm:
The data structure must be sorted <br />
Access to any element of the data structure takes constant time. <br />
